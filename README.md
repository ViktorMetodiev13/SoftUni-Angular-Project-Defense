# How to run it? Here is a quick guide

To run this project, in the project directory, use the following commands in a new terminal:

```
$ cd ./client
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```

This opens the app at http://localhost:4200/ in your browser. However it will not work until you don't start the RESTful API server. To start the server you have to be in the project directory and do the following steps:

```
$ cd ./server
$ npm install
$ node ./server.js
```

And the server will start listening on port 8080.
